This library is pre-built by MediaTek internally.


WHAT IT DOES?
============
spir2cl is a project based on open source project llvm-cbe.

We modify llvm-cbe to tranforming SPIR 1.2 to OpenCL C 1.2.

resurrected LLVM "C Backend", with improvements

HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================
It needs the following library from AOSP:

  libLLVMIRReader
  libLLVMLinker
  libLLVMIRReader
  libLLVMAsmParser
  libLLVMAsmPrinter
  libLLVMBitWriter
  libLLVMInstrumentation
  libLLVMObject
  libLLVMSelectionDAG
  libLLVMCodeGen
  libLLVMScalarOpts
  libLLVMTransformUtils
  libLLVMDebugInfoDWARF
  libLLVMDebugInfoPDB
  libLLVMAnalysis
  libLLVMTarget
  libLLVMMCParser
  libLLVMBitReader
  libLLVMMC
  libLLVMCore
  libLLVMSupport
  libcutils
  libdl

and the following libs from MediaTek:
  libspir2cl

HOW TO USE IT?
==============
